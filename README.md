#  SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Prediction

This project is the final capstone for the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate** on Coursera.

##  Goal

Predict whether the first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket will **land successfully**, using publicly available data and classification models.

##  What Was Done

- **Data Collection**: via SpaceX REST API + web scraping Wikipedia  
- **Data Wrangling**: cleaning, feature engineering, one-hot encoding  
- **EDA**: visualizing trends in payload, orbits, launch sites, and success rates  
- **Machine Learning**: compared Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, and Decision Tree  
- ✅ **Best model**: **Decision Tree** (highest accuracy and F1-score)

##  Project Files

- Jupyter notebooks: data collection, wrangling, EDA, modeling  
- PDF report: `ds-capstone-template-coursera.pdf`  
- GitHub repo: [MaxBoulanger-Maker/IBM_CAPSTONE_HEC](https://github.com/MaxBoulanger-Maker/IBM_CAPSTONE_HEC)
